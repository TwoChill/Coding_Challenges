# <Hacking Task #1>

Now that you're no longer a total JavaScript n00bster,
you can help Elliott and the fSociety crew with a little pet project.
Security is paramount to this group of anarchist rebels.
And someone has to make sure that their hideout is not compromised.

The password to enter the Arcade has to be kept secure, and it changes every day.
The first seven characters change every week, while the last ones are updated every day.
The daily password is generated by appending to the weekly password 
the consonants of the day of the week we are in.

You job is to create a piece of software that automatically updates the password
every time a day goes by and print it.

## Instructions

* Having got the value of the weekly password stored in weeklyPass,
update the value of currentPass depending on the day of the week we are in.
To know which day of the week it is simply access weekDay.

* Remember that updating the password is appending the letters corresponding
to the consonants present in the name of the current day of the week.

* There are many ways of cracking this problem,
but Elliot and the guys specifically asked for you to use a switch statement...
